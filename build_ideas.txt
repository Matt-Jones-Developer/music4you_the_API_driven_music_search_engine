// We need 2 API's (I'm suggesting Last.fm and Discogs)

-> Last.fm
    // grab data including name (artist/band), description, bio, artwork etc
    // track recommendations: recommend tracks based on their search history

-> Discogs - seems a little bit OTT (see the fetch data it returns)
    // detailed info about upcoming concerts and tour dates
    // discography fetching (have an entire album art grid of the artists complete discography)



-> alternatives|

    -> fetch lyrics ?
    -> ticketmaster ? (Micheal has API key)
