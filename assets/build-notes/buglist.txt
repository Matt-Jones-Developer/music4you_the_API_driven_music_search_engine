// Current BUGLIST and issues/fixes [TODOS]

// card removal:

card will remove (OK)
array will remove say second item, of 3 cards, correctly
// BUT! if then remove the first, it keeps the name of the first, instead of the third?
// its a poor index solution that isn't quite doing what I think it does
// if we make the artistObject object store instead, hopefully it will solve this??

// or double check the index code - what is it doing??


// if garbage entered, it stays in the Array

// the garbage collector only catches 'typos/garbage'
/TODO/ if user types in a "correct name" (but NOT an artist) - error will return 
  // 'name' not found or something (its a different bug to fix)

!! major !!
// retrieve local storage - causes issues with logic regarding card removal
  // also we had to make searchRequest global, cannot call on the API to re-render the data or cards 

!! major !!
// when refresh - cards disappear
/DONE/ array and local are correct 
  // must re-call API, tap into the saved artists - pull up their data,
  // arrange it via correct data-index and then regenerate cards  !!

// if genre NOT IN genreArray = ['pop', 'rock', grunge', 'dubstep']
  // quite an array length to solve the 'amazing' or 'micheal jackson' error in genre!
    // but if not, use the discogs genre data as an alternative genre label

// hidden easter egg! search 'mel gibson' or 'tom hanks' hahahahah

!! important !!
// if artist name.length > 13: reduce font-size! 

// type 'christina' will show C Aguilera, but type 'katy' will blank art and some rando steely dan album??

// some icons would be nice - ticket/info/list/music etc
